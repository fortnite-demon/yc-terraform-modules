  ---Important information---
  If you want to specify a user's network, 
  then specify its ID and not its name as the map() key.
  ---------------------------

  Placeholders explain where you should insert/come up with 
  your own values for resources, in this case for network and subnet names.
  Example: `<network-name>`

  `<network-name|exist-network-id>`: The name of the network to be created or the ID of an existing network
    `folder_id`: ID of the folder where the network will be hosted
    `user_net`: If you specify an already created network, that is, its identifier, then you must specify (true), 
                as if to say that this is a user network, for the networks that need to be created, use (false)
    `subnets` Block for subnets configuration
      `zone`: The availability zone where the subnet will be located
      `v4_cidr_blocks`: IPv4 CIDR blocks for this subnet
      `folder_id`: Id of the folder where the subnet will be located. If folder_id is specified for the network, 
                   the ID will be taken from there, otherwise from var.folder_id
      `labels`: Labels for this subnet.

  Placeholders indicate where to put custom values,

  ---Important information---
  If you want to assign only a NAT gateway to private networks, then list only the list of these networks, 
  without specifying routes, but note that you also need to create a NAT, that is, specify the network in var.nat_gws
