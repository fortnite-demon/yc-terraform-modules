# Terraform Yandex VPC Module

This Terraform module is designed for creating and managing Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in Yandex Cloud. It provides flexible options for creating networks, subnets, NAT gateways, route tables, and security groups.

## Description

The module allows you to create VPCs with various configurations, including:

•   **Networks:** Creating new networks or using existing ones.  
•   **Subnets:** Creating subnets in different availability zones with customizable CIDR blocks.  
•   **NAT Gateways:** Creating NAT gateways to provide internet access for resources in private subnets.  
•   **Route Tables:** Configuring route tables for public and private subnets.  
•   **Security Groups:** Creating security groups to manage inbound and outbound traffic.  

The module is intended to simplify and standardize the process of creating VPCs in Yandex Cloud, making it more automated and reliable.  

## Usage

    `name`: (Optional) The name of the route table, defaults to "route_table_public".  
    `subnets_names`: (Required) List of subnet names.  
        `static_routes`: (Optional) List of static routes.  
            `destination_prefix`: (Required) The destination prefix.  
            `next_hop_address`: (Required) The IP address of the next hop.
```

#### `route_table_private_subnets`  

•   **(Optional)** Configuration of route tables for private subnets.  
•   **Type:** `map(object(...))`  
•   **Description:**

    `subnets_names`: (Required) List of subnet names.  
    `static_routes`: (Optional) List of static routes.  
        `destination_prefix`: (Required) The destination prefix.  
        `next_hop_address`: (Required) The IP address of the next hop.
```

#### `sec_groups`  

•   **(Optional)** Configuration of security groups.  
•   **Type:** `map(object(...))`  
•   **Description:**  
```
`name`: (Optional) The name of the security group, defaults to "sec-group".  
    `ingress`: (Optional) List of rules for inbound traffic.  
        `description`: (Optional) Description of the rule.  
        from_port`: (Optional) The starting port.  
        `to_port`: (Optional) The ending port.
